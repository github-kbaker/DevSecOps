# SCRIPT STATUS: WORKING. Results obtained after running twice on May 24, 2018.
# This performs the commands described in the "Cloud ML Engine: Qwik Start" (GSP076) hands-on lab at
#    https://google-run.qwiklab.com/catalog_lab/676 
#    https://google-run.qwiklab.com/focuses/725?parent=catalog
# which is part of quest https://google-run.qwiklab.com/quests/34 (Baseline: Data, ML, AI)
# and https://google-run.qwiklab.com/quests/32 (Machine Learning APIs)

# Instead of typing, copy this command to run in the console within the cloud:
# sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wilsonmar/DevSecOps/master/qwiklabs/gcp-cloudml-GSP076.sh)"

# The script, by Wilson Mar, Wisdom Hambolu, and others,
# adds steps to grep values into variables for variation and verification,
# so you can spend time learning and experimenting rather than typing and fixing typos.
# This script deletes folders left over from previous run so can be rerun (within the same session).
